## What I built
Grabbit is a marketplace app inspired by Kijiji/eBay. Users can browse listings, search/filter, message sellers, and pay securely.

## Highlights
- Microservices-based backend with Node.js + Express
- MongoDB data model for listings, users, and transactions
- Stripe payments integration
- JWT authentication for secure sessions
- Tested APIs using Postman and SoapUI
